            <p>
              Despite the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, the
              Illinois and national housing markets have been in a unique
              position, with low mortgage rates and low inventory encouraging
              buyers to bid above the asking price and buy homes as soon as they
              are listed. Many people are wondering if the real estate market
              will remain hot or if we're headed for a downturn as vaccination
              rates rise and the economy reopens. In this article, we look back
              at 2020, assess where we are now, and examine real estate market
              forecasts for the rest of 2021.

            <h4>The Illinois Real Estate Market in 2020:</h4>
            <br />
            <p>
              The Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate to nearly
              zero at the start of the pandemic last year. While this move
              intended to aid an economy that was suddenly in crisis due to the
              closure of businesses and schools, it also contributed to last
              year's rising home prices and limited supply. <br /> Many homeowners
              refinanced their mortgages, and others took out home equity loans
              or lines of credit to finance renovation projects when mortgage
              interest rates fell to historically low levels last year. People
              added home offices, family rooms, and other new spaces as we
              adjusted to the new social distancing way of life or improved
              kitchens and bathrooms that were suddenly seeing a lot more use. <br />
              While many homeowners chose to stay put and improve their spaces,
              others, particularly those living in densely populated urban
              areas, felt compelled to upgrade to a larger home and/or acquire
              more outdoor space. As a result, a supply-and-demand situation
              arose, with a large number of buyers and fewer sellers than usual. <br />
              The real estate market in Illinois was impacted by the same trends
              that were seen across the country in 2020. Home sales increased in
              2020, while inventory decreased, according to Illinois REALTORS®.
              Last year, annual closed sales increased by 9.6%, while the annual
              median sales price increased by 7.7%. Meanwhile, the number of
              homes for sale in Illinois fell by 38.8 percent between 2018 and
              2019. <br /> Despite the uncertainty and economic pain caused by the
              pandemic, the Illinois housing market reached a high point in
              2020. The question now is whether the real estate market will
              remain hot until 2021.

            <h4>So far, in 2021:</h4>
            <br />
            <p>
              According to the most recent market update from Illinois
              REALTORS®, "as consumers' appetite for homes coincided with the
              traditional real estate season, a reduced inventory led to faster
              sales and higher median prices in May." <br /> Closed sales and median
              sales price are up from May 2020, inventory is down 45.7 percent,
              and days on the market until sale are down 20 days from last year. <br />
              As a result, the Illinois housing market will remain hot into the
              first half of 2021, with demand outstripping supply and many
              listings receiving multiple offers above the asking price. The big
              question is how long it will last. <br /> According to an Illinois
              REALTORS® market forecast for 2021, "median prices are forecast to
              grow in 2021 within a higher and broader range than in 2020," and
              "sales are forecast to experience overall positive gains in 2021
              for Illinois." In particular, average mortgage rates are expected
              to remain around 3%, which may encourage homebuyers to act now to
              lock in these historically low rates.

            <h4>What comes next?:</h4>
            <br />
            <p>
              Although the housing market is hot right now, Illinois had one of
              the weakest real estate markets in the country before 2020,
              according to Illinois Policy. When the economy collapsed at the
              start of the pandemic, more than a million people in the state
              lost their jobs, and mortgage delinquencies reached new highs.
              Unfortunately, that trend has continued into 2021, with Illinois
              having the second-highest rate of foreclosures in March. <br /> People
              start talking about a crash whenever the housing market heats up,
              but there is no data to support an impending crash. There are
              still many variables to contend with in real estate, as there are
              in every other sector of the economy's recovery. As an example, <br /> In
              the Illinois REALTORS® 2021 market forecast, "The uneven impact of
              the COVID-19 pandemic on employment by sector and income level is
              likely to be reflected in the housing market in 2021," said
              Geoffrey J.D. Hewings, Director of the University of Illinois'
              Regional Economics Applications Laboratory. <br /> Increasing remote work
              opportunities for white-collar workers may drive demand in
              suburban and exurban areas with larger homes, layoffs, and
              furloughs for retail, leisure, and hospitality workers may reduce
              supply and demand in the bottom quarter of the price distribution.
